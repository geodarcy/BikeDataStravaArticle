# BikeDataStravaArticle

Collaboration project with Matt Dance to write a short article for Spacing Edmonton. An attempt wil be made to contribute to the biking data conversation in Edmonton. Attention will be paid to the collection, distribution, and analysis of open datasets and to the Strava heatmap.

I'm proposing to use the Rob Vestrum four step writing process:

1. write all ideas in point form in no particular order.
2. organize ideas
3. flush out ideas
4. Complete writing

No timeline for writing yet.
